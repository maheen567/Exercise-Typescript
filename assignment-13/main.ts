//Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
let cars :string[]=["Lamborghini", "Ferrari", "BMW"];
for(let i=0; i<cars.length; i++) {                       //for loop
     console.log('I would like to own a ' + cars[i]);
